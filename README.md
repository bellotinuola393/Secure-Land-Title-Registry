# Secure Land Title Registry

A blockchain-based solution for transparent, immutable land ownership records and property transactions.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized land title registry system that provides secure, verifiable property records. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a tamper-proof system that reduces fraud, simplifies transactions, and increases trust in property ownership claims.

## Core Components

### Property Registration Contract
- Records land boundaries, coordinates, and physical characteristics
- Stores ownership information with cryptographic verification
- Maintains historical ownership records and provenance
- Links to supporting documentation (surveys, deeds, etc.)
- Implements geospatial data verification for boundary accuracy

### Transfer Verification Contract
- Validates legitimate property transactions between parties
- Implements multi-signature requirements for ownership transfers
- Verifies identity of buyers and sellers through secure authentication
- Creates permanent record of transfer agreements and terms
- Ensures regulatory compliance with local property laws

### Lien Recording Contract
- Tracks financial claims and encumbrances against properties
- Records mortgage information and priority of claims
- Manages release of liens upon obligation fulfillment
- Provides notification system for interested parties
- Ensures transparency of all financial obligations attached to property

### Subdivision Management Contract
- Handles division of larger parcels into smaller lots
- Verifies compliance with zoning regulations and restrictions
- Manages creation of new property identifiers for subdivided parcels
- Maintains relationship between parent and child properties
- Creates updated boundary records for newly formed parcels
